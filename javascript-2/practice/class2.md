## Class 2 Extra Practice

#### Exercise 1

Create a new array 'uppercaseNames' by using .map() to capitalize each name in the `oneNameSingers` array below

- Hint: You'll need a string method to capitalize the names

```js
let oneNameSingers = ['Beyonce', 'Cher', 'Bjork', 'Sia'];
```

#### Exercise 2

Filter out numbers less than 100 in the array below

```js
let largeNumbers = [300, 24, 9350, -2, 147, 59];
```

#### Exercise 3

Use forEach() to add an 's' to each string in the array below and print the new plural string to the console

```js
let singularNouns = ['pen', 'book', 'house', 'bike'];
```

#### Exercise 4

Test if every element in the below array is an even number

```js
let checkNumbers = [4, 10, 56, 34];
```

#### Exercise 5

Find out if any word in the array below contains the string 'cat'

```js
let catStrings = ['avocado', 'advocate', 'catty', 'catacomb'];
```

#### Exercise 6

Rewrite your solution to Exercise 5 to use a different iteration method that returns the index of the element that satisfies the test condition

#### Exercise 7

Create an empty array `duplicatePlanets`

Using the .forEach method, loop through the planets array below and push each item into the duplicatePlanets array

```js
let planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Jupiter'];
```
