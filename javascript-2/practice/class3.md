## Class 3 Extra Practice

#### Object Practice - Part 1

Create an object called `studentData`

Add the following keys or properties, and assign whatever values you'd like:

- studentName
- cityOfOrigin
- age (takes a number)
- major
- registeredClasses (takes a number)

Create a method called 'greeting' that prints the following greeting using the object keys:

'Hello my name is (studentName); I'm (age) years old; and I'm from (cityOfOrigin)

(Tip: Use string interpolation for the greeting message)

Use the `this` keyword with the key properties in the `greeting()` method

Log the `studentData` object to the console

Run the `greeting()` method

#### Object Practice - Part 2

Working with the `studentData` object:

- Change the studentName value
- Change the age value
- Delete the major key
- Print the studentData object to verify the updates

#### Object Practice - Part 3

Working with the `studentData` object:

- Using dot notation, add a new method called `declareMajor`

- It takes a parameter 'major'. (Hint: You deleted the property 'major' in Part 2; do not add it back as a key. You'll instead pass an argument to the method when you call it.)

- It prints the following message: 'I'm studying (major), and I'm registered for (registeredClasses) this semester.'

- Print the studentData object to verify the update

- Run the declareMajor() method with an argument
