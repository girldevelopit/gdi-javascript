## Class 4 Extra Practice

#### Exercise 1 - for...in loop

Loop through `studentData` object and log its values to the console

```js
let studentData = {
  studentName: 'Javi',
  cityOfOrigin: 'Madrid',
  age: 34,
};
```

#### Exercise 2 - Object.entries()

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/fromEntries#syntax

Using Object.entries, turn the `newData` array below into an object

Then using the object method practiced in class, combine the new object with the studentData object

Print or verify that studentData has been updated

```js
let newData = [
  ['major', 'philosophy'],
  ['classesRegistered', 5],
];
```
